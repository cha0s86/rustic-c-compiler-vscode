# The Rustic C language is basically just a language of c++ with minor changes...
# The changes are int -> integer and float -> decimal, atleast for now.
# Parser probably has errors, if i encounter problems i will try to solve them.
# You can create .rc files and write "rc code", with keywords integer and decimal
# Just write rc code like c++ and that's it!
